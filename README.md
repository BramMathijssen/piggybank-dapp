## Description
This application has been developed from the ground up. It is a decentralized platform that allows parents to educate their children
about saving cryptocurrencies in a secure environment. Parents can create new tokens and keep them vested in the contract, and also 
set up a claiming schedule for their children to claim the cryptocurrency of their choice. The child can claim their tokens on a
daily, weekly, or monthly basis. In order to promote patience, a 10% bonus will be given if the child selects the monthly interval,
while a -10% reduction will be applied for the daily interval.

## Features
- Parent: Mint new tokens and keep them vested in the contract
- Parent: Add children to the allowance list including their name, token and base allowance
- Child: Modify the token of their choice (which has been minted and vested by their parent)
- Child: Change their prefered claim period daily (-10%), weekly (base), monthly (+10%)
- Child: Claim the token of their choice after the claim moment has been reached
