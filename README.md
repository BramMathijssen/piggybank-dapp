# Piggy Bank Front-End

## Technologies
- Sass: for global styles such as colors
- CSS Modules: for seperation of concerns of the class names

## Conventions
- Written classNames for the CSS modules in camelCase instead of kebab-case
- Used a folder structure in which the components are grouped by the page/route they belong to

## Design
- The design style is called Neubrutalism, alot of inspiration has been taken from www.dribbble.com
